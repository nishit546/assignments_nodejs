# Student Management System API (Assignment 1)

## Project Title
Student Management System API - Assignment 1 Node.js

## Objective
To build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to manage and retrieve student records. The API allows getting a list of all students, finding the top-performing student, calculating the average CGPA, getting the total count of students, and filtering records by ID or branch.

## List of implemented routes
- `GET /` : Welcome message.
- `GET /students` : Retrieve the list of all students.
- `GET /students/topper` : Retrieve the student with the highest CGPA.
- `GET /students/average` : Calculate and retrieve the average CGPA of all students.
- `GET /students/count` : Retrieve the total number of students.
- `GET /students/:id` : Retrieve a specific student by their ID.
- `GET /students/branch/:branchName` : Retrieve a list of students belonging to a specific branch.
